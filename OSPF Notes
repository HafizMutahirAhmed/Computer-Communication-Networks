Area 0 -> backbone Area
DR -> 
if DR Gets down then BDR takes its place.
that's why OSPF is called hierarchcal routing. 
OSPF by default supports subnetting. 
OSPF have by default Wild card mask.
inverse of subnet mask is wild card mask and is used for matching purposes.
e.g if subnet mask is 255.0.0.0 then its wild card mask is 0.255.255.255;
same as dynamic routing,

ospf 1 <-
number of zeros in the power of 2 identifies  number of hosts in a subnet
number of ones in the power of 2 identifies
variable length subnet mask = VLSM
